# Battleship!

## Project Description

For my Project 1 assignment, I would like to create a virtual Battleship game where the user would play againsed the computer using the browser window. This will be developed using HTML & CSS for the frontend, and Javascript for the backend.
If I find time towards the end of week, I would like for the computer player to be powered by AI ([open sourcse battleship AI](https://github.com/billmei/battleboat/blob/gh-pages/js/battleboat.js)) or [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)!


## Figma Mockup

I have chosen Figma to mockup my game in its entirety to accuretly represent how my game will look and function in real life using the Prototype feature.
The mockup can be accessed by clicking [Here](https://www.figma.com/proto/rMsr7wH4sejv7vLemCtTaS/Battleship-Game-Mockups?page-id=0:1&type=design&node-id=5-204&viewport=3659,2329,0.77&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=5:204)

## Create files and folders

The file explorer is accessible using the button in left corner of the navigation bar. You can create a new file by clicking the **New file** button in the file explorer. You can also create folders by clicking the **New folder** button.

## User Stories

#### MVP Goals
 - As a player, you can choose your desired boats and place them wherever you want on the 8x8 grid either virtically or horizantaly.
 - As the computer, it will do the same automatically.
 - As the player, you will be able to reset the game at anytime to get a clean slate and restart the game.
 - As a player, you will be able to attack any position on the board and know if you hit the opponents ship or not by seeing a **red box** or a **X box** indecating "Hit" or "Miss".
 - As a player, you will know when the game is over my seeing a message saying who won by sinking all the ships first.

#### Stretch Goals

 - Integrate either the AI algerithym mentioned above, or use ChatGPT as the opponent.
 - Some fun/cool animations for all gameplay.
